bubblesheet
===========

LaTeX code to make bubble sheets (good for coffee pools, communal
beer, etc).  This code was handed down through generations of grad
students at the University of British Columbia.  Lore has it that the
Great Brodsky Brothers are its original authors.


Usage:

  pdflatex espresso.tex
  open espresso.pdf


Enjoy.
