bubblesheet
===========

LaTeX code to make bubble sheets (good for coffee pools, communal
beer, etc).  This code was handed down through generations of grad
students at the University of British Columbia.  Lore has it that the
Great Brodsky Brothers are its original authors.  There is rumored to
be a billing script that goes along with this, and indeed I have some
hazy memories of running said script, attempting to collect money from
my delinquent colleagues, breaking kneecaps, and hauling wagonloads of
pennies to the bank.  Or maybe I just checked off one too many bubbles
on the beer sheet.

Typical use:

  edit espresso.tex for your organization
  >> pdflatex espresso.tex
  print espresso.pdf


Enjoy.
